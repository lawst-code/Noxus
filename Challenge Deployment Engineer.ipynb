    "# Use Case Document: Dynamic Price Build-up\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines the requirements and workflow for automating the product pricing process for our client, **FreshRoute Logistics**. The goal is to provide a clear foundation for the technical challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview & Objective üéØ\n",
    "\n",
    "FreshRoute Logistics currently uses a manual, Excel-based process to calculate the final sales price of its products. This process is time-consuming, prone to error, and relies on individuals manually collecting and inputting data from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** of this project is to create an automated workflow that dynamically calculates the final price for products, starting with the **\"Fruits & Vegetables\"** category. This automated solution will integrate multiple data sources, apply complex business logic, and produce a transparent, auditable price report enriched with live market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Business Champion:** David (Fruits & Vegetables)\n",
    "* **Process Owner:** Alex\n",
    "* **IT Lead:** Sam\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Information Sourcing üìö\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated workflow must pull data from several distinct sources, which are provided as separate files in this challenge package.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Source | Type | Information Provided |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Product Master File** | Internal System / CSV File | ‚Ä¢ Product SKU & Name<br>‚Ä¢ Base Cost<br>‚Ä¢ Standard Unit of Measure (e.g., box, pallet) |\n",
    "| **Trade Data Service** | External API | ‚Ä¢ International commodity prices<br>‚Ä¢ Standard import tariffs & duties |\n",
    "| **Logistics Partner** | External (Email / Future API) | ‚Ä¢ Shipping quotes<br>‚Ä¢ Freight costs<br>‚Ä¢ Fuel surcharges |\n",
    "| **Business Rules Engine** | Internal Logic | ‚Ä¢ Category-specific markups<br>‚Ä¢ Unit conversions<br>‚Ä¢ \"Hidden\" operational fees |\n",
    "| **AI Web Agents** | External Web Scraping | ‚Ä¢ Competitor pricing<br>‚Ä¢ Product descriptions<br>‚Ä¢ Market promotions |\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Price Deconstruction Model ‚öôÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "The final price is \"deconstructed\" from several cost components. The workflow must calculate the price sequentially, as detailed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final price, or **Pre√ßo de Venda Final (PVF)**, is calculated using the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PVF = (\\text{Custo Base} + \\text{Custos de Transporte} + \\text{Taxas de Importa√ß√£o} + \\text{Outras Taxas}) \\times (1 + \\text{Margem})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow executes these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** The process begins with a product SKU. It retrieves the **`Custo Base`** (Base Cost) from the internal Product Master File.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Data Aggregation:** The system makes calls to:\n",
    "    * The **Trade Data Service API** to fetch applicable **`Taxas de Importa√ß√£o`**.\n",
    "    * **Logistics Partners** to gather **`Custos de Transporte`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Core Calculation:**\n",
    "    * The system calculates the **Total Cost of Acquisition (TCA)** by summing the base cost and all collected fees:\n",
    "        * `TCA = Custo Base + Custos de Transporte + Taxas de Importa√ß√£o + Outras Taxas`\n",
    "    * The `Outras Taxas` component is calculated by applying internal business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Unit & Margin Application:**\n",
    "    * The system applies necessary **unit conversions** (e.g., TCA per box to TCA per kg).\n",
    "    * Finally, it applies the pre-defined **`Margem`** (Margin) for the product category to determine the **`Pre√ßo de Venda Final`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Market Enrichment & Final Output üåê\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the internal cost-based price is only half the battle. To make an intelligent business decision, this price must be contextualized with live market data. This is an advanced step in the workflow where our platform's AI capabilities shine.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the initial price is calculated, the workflow deploys **AI agents** to browse the web and gather public intelligence. This enrichment includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Competitor Pricing:** Scraping key competitor websites (e.g., Continente, Pingo Doce) for their current prices on the same or similar products.\n",
    "* **Market Analysis:** Automatically calculating key metrics, such as the **median competitor price**.\n",
    "* **Actionable Recommendations:** Generating a simple, AI-driven suggestion based on how our calculated price compares to the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output of the workflow is a comprehensive report that combines the internal cost deconstruction with this external market intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Your Challenge üöÄ\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interviewee, your task is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Map the Workflow:** Using the mock data provided in the accompanying files, propose which specific components of our platform you would use to execute each step of the **Price Deconstruction Model** and the **Market Enrichment** phase.\n",
    "2.  **Design the Flow:** Create a workflow that represents the entire automated process, from receiving an SKU to generating the final enriched report.\n",
    "3.  **Identify Risks:** What are two potential challenges in building this automation (especially concerning the web data collection), and how would you propose to mitigate them?\n",

    "| **BR-02** | Hidden Fees | For all fruit shipments, add a 2.5% \"Cold Chain Integrity Fee\" calculated on the `BaseCostEUR`. |\n",
    "| **BR-03** | Shipping Surcharge | The `Sobretaxa de Combust√≠vel` percentage from the email quote must be applied to the `Custo de Frete`. The total transport cost is `Frete + (Frete * Sobretaxa)`. |\n",
